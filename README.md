🍷 Wine Quality Prediction System 🧪

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction System! This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features. The goal is to assist wine producers and enthusiasts in evaluating wine quality using data-driven insights.

📊 Project Overview

In this project, we:

Loaded and explored the Wine Quality Dataset.
Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Applied the Logistic Regression model to classify wine quality.
Achieved a test accuracy of 86.67% ✅.
🧠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python
📘 Pandas, NumPy
📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn
🤖 Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)
🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, pH, alcohol) of red wine samples and their corresponding quality scores (0–10). It is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
