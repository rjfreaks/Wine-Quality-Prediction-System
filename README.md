## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, we:
- Loaded and explored the **Wine Quality Dataset**.
- Performed **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to understand feature distributions and correlations.
- Applied the **Logistic Regression** model to classify wine quality.
- Achieved a test accuracy of **86.67%** ✅.
